11.19.19
General code house keeping

Uncommented/activated code for Magazine solenoid. The magazine solenoid will active when the round count reaches 15. This will push the slide stop up so that when the magazine is removed the slide will still remain in its retracted state.

Created wiring schematic for receiving signal from the prox sensor, and transmitting power to the slide solenoid. 

Next goals: draw the schematic for transceivers setup before then and Im going to check on grab cad for tof sensor, (VL53L0x), Wireless transceivers, proximity sensor, grab cad look for files of the same.


11.26.19

continued work on electrical schematic. Was unable to locate electronic cad files on grabcad so created custom tof sensor. Continued translating physical circuits to electrical schematic

removed unused declarations. Cleanup, add grounds, schematics uploaded to git(now accessible)

Now that all wiring diagrams are completed, the next step is to incorporate all of the present physical electronics into one circuit

After that need to design PCB/ pick components/chips for custom PCB

Then design custom PCB paths and order them



12.4.19
Pins are incorrect on magazine schematic.
slide schematic altered to correct pin assignments 
TLDR got code to compile in arduino. Next steps add serial printf statements for debugging
